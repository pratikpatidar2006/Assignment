Input: [10, 20, 30] → Highest = 30, Lowest = 10, Count Above 75 = 0
Input: [100, 99, 98] → Highest = 100, Lowest = 98, Count Above 75 = 3

for i in range(n):
      x=input("enter marks of student : ")
      if int(x)>75:
          count+=1
      marks.append(x)
print("List :",marks)
print("Highest :",max(marks))
print("Lowest :",min(marks))
print("count student who Score 75 :",count)
