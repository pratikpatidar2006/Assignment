An online examination system stores marks of multiple classes.
Each class contains multiple students, and each student has marks for multiple subjects.

The program should use:
- First loop for classes
- Second loop for students
- Third loop for subjects

The system calculates total marks of every student.

Input:
Enter number of classes: 2
Enter students per class: 2
Enter subjects per student: 3

Class 1

Student 1
Enter mark: 70
Enter mark: 80
Enter mark: 90

Student 2
Enter mark: 60
Enter mark: 75
Enter mark: 85

Class 2

Student 1
Enter mark: 88
Enter mark: 77
Enter mark: 66

Student 2
Enter mark: 90
Enter mark: 92
Enter mark: 95

Output:
